## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the role for your ansible playbook. Once launched, it will install a [Redis](https://redis.io/) server.

### Prerequisities

Ansible 2.2.1.0 version installed.
Inventory destination should be a Debian environment.

For testing purposes, [Molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/) with [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) as driver (with [landrush](https://github.com/vagrant-landrush/landrush) plugin) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) as provider.

### Installing

Create or add to your roles dependency file (e.g requirements.yml):

```
- src: http://github.com/idealista/redis-role.git
  scm: git
  version: 1.0.0
  name: redis
```

Install the role with ansible-galaxy command:

```
ansible-galaxy install -p roles -r requirements.yml -f
```

Use in a playbook:

```
- hosts: someserver
  roles:
    - role: redis
```

## Usage

Look to the [defaults](defaults/main.yml) properties file to see the possible configuration properties.

## Testing

### Testing cluster mode

```sh
cd test/cluster-mode
molecule test
```

The default test start a cluster of three docker container. To test cluster with six nodes uncomment containers definition on test/cluster-mode/molecule.yml and set replicas to 1 on group_vars and the run `molecule test`

This test have been removed from Travis CI because it takes too much time.

### Testing single mode

```sh
cd test/single-mode
molecule test
```
